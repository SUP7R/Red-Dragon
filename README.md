# 🐉 Red Dragon – Security Simulation Tool

**Red Dragon** is a powerful simulation tool designed to raise awareness about mobile security and the dangers of excessive app permissions.  
This project is intended **strictly for educational and ethical testing purposes** — not for spying or violating user privacy.

---

## 🛡️ Overview

**Red Dragon** is an intelligent security simulation app that demonstrates how malicious applications could access private user data if given unnecessary permissions. It helps:

- Educate users about permission abuse.
- Demonstrate privacy risks to students and developers.
- Simulate how unauthorized access can occur in insecure apps.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To raise awareness among users, researchers, and developers regarding:

- The dangers of apps requesting unnecessary or excessive permissions.
- How app behavior can be simulated for safe educational purposes.

---

## 📱 App Information

- **Platform**: Android
- **Language**: Java
- **Frameworks**: Android SDK, Firebase
- **Usage**: Education, testing, awareness campaigns

---

## 🛠️ Simulated Capabilities

> ⚠️ These simulations **use real data** and should only be run in a test environment (e.g. Android emulator or test phone).

Upon launch, the app simulates:

- 📷 "Extracting" images from media folders
- 📞 Accessing contact list numbers
- 💬 Simulating SMS read behavior
- 📍 Dynamic location tracking simulation
- 📱 Displaying device information:
  - Device name
  - Manufacturer
  - OS version
  - Build number

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Stealth Mode Simulation

The app includes a simulated **stealth mode** feature:
- Demonstrates how some apps can hide from the app drawer
- Runs in the background without user awareness (for simulation purposes only)

---

## ⚠️ Warning

- ❌ **This app accesses real device data.**
- ✅ Only use on **authorized testing devices** or Android **emulators**.
- 🚫 **Never deploy this app on personal or third-party devices without consent.**

---

## 👨‍💻 Who Is This For?

- Cybersecurity students
- Ethical hackers and pentesters
- Mobile app developers learning about permission management
- Educational institutions or trainers

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Java** (Android SDK)
- **Firebase** (Simulating cloud storage & analytics)
- **Custom Simulation Layer** for:
  - Location
  - Contacts
  - SMS
  - Media access

---

## 🧠 Important Note

This tool is built for ethical, legal, and educational use only.  
**Do not** use it for spying, surveillance, or unauthorized monitoring.  
Violation of ethical boundaries or local laws is strictly discouraged and not supported by the creators.
